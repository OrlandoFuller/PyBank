# Objective
In this activity, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

# Comments
I enjoyed coding this particular script. It was moderately challenging but when I managed to finish it I was satistified with my work.
